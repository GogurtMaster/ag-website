        <h2>Nuclear Power is Often Misunderstood</h2>
        <p>Nuclear power is the key to slowing climate change and moving away from fossil fules. <br>
        However its often misunderstood and thought to be very dangerous. <br>
        But countries across the globe have already started to adopt nuclear power as the future of energy.</p>

          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p> When we burn fossil fuels for electricity they give off greenhouse gasses.
              These greenhouse gasses move up into the atmosphere and trap the heat from
              the sun, this creates a greenhouse effect where more heat
              is coming in than is getting out which causes global warming.<br>
              By burning fossil fuels we released 36.8 billion metric tons of carbon
              dioxide into the atmosphere in 2023 alone. This is a huge part of why
              every year it feels like we are setting new records for the hottest summer. 
              If this continues then it's only going to get hotter and hotter untill it 
              becomes imposible to grow crops or provide enough food for everyone.

          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>1 kilogram of natural uranium is able to produce the same amount of electricity
              as 20 metric tons of coal without producing any greenhouse gasses. Nuclear power
              also doesn't require as much space as solar or wind turbines do. It is one of the
              cleanest and most effective energy sources we have right now and in the US in 2023
              We produced 18% of our power with nuclear energy, so we are already on our way! 
              However we still need to work hard to get that number up. It's important for 
              future generations that we start acting now to slow down or even stop climate 
              change before it's too late.</p>

            <p>Some of the challenges we face when it come to nuclear power are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Public Perception</li>
              <p>Due to misinformation and accidents like chernobyl and fukushima lots of people are scared
                of nuclear power plants but with how strict the safety policies are now these kinds of
                accidents are unlikely.</p>
              <li>High Initial Costs</li>
              <p>Nuclear plants are expensive to build upfront, however they don't take as much land as other
                renewables and they create lots of job openings from construction jobs to helping run the
                plant after its been built.</p>
              <li>Safety Risks</li>
              <p>Lots of people perceive nuclear power plants as very dangerous because of accidents like
                chernobyl and hiroshima, however accidents like those are very uncommon.However fukushima
                was struck by multiple tsunamis causing the meltdown, and chernobyl was a combination of
                flawed design and a power surge and modern technology and safety measures have made
                todayâ€™s nuclear power plants safer and more efficient than ever before.</p>

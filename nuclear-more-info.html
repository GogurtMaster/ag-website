      <h2>Welcome to the More Information Page</h2>
      <p>Here you can find additional details about nuclear power.</p>

      <h3>What is nuclear energy?</h3>
      <p>Nuclear energy is a carbon free way to produce electricity bys spliting atoms 
        to preduce heat and steam.</p>

      <h3>Benififts of going Nuclear</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Helps fight climate change by replacing fossil fuels</li>
        <li>Produces reliable energy 24/7 and can run for up to 24 months at a time</li>
        <li>Creates more jobs to support economies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What happenes to the fuel after its been used?</h3>
      <p>After about 24 moths a reactor has to stop makeing power for a 
        short time to replace some of the used fuel.<br>
        The used fuel is then safely stored untill we have a 
        way to properly dispose of it</p>

      <h3>Are Nuclear plants safe?</h3>
      <p>Accidnets like chernobyl and fukushima were just that accidents.<br>
    because of advancements in technology it is very unlikely for these kinds 
    of meltdowns to happen especially with the safty protacals we have in the U.S.</p>
